# Project: CV Application

The CV app allows the user to create a... CV based on their input. Currently, it is only limited to personal information, experience, and education - data is saved on localStorage.

This project is [part of The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-cv-application) curriculum - and is my first ReactJS project. Coming from vanilla JavaScript, I was initially confused on how state and props works. This project is very helpful in learning these new concepts.
